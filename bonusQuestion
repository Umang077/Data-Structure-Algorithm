Q.Try to find a way to link the family members' doubly-linked list based on their relationship.
Ans. This can be done by sorting the doubly linked list in decending order according to age,
by doing so we will get a doubly linked list in which older generation people will be closer 
to head in double linked list and new generation people will be closer to tail in doubly linked list.
